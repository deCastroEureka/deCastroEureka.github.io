	<p>So, you're here to be inspired, to be motivated, to receive whatever knowledge a kid like me can impart to you, well, to be honest, the only piece of advice I can give you right now is to click that return button. No one could have described it better than Anna Kendrick, I'm just a Scrappy Little Nobody, and I bet there thousands of people in the internet INCLUDING Anna that have thrice the experience and a billion times the wisdom who are more worth your internet surfing time.

Essentially, it gets math nerds from all around the country and fills their brain with even more math, sends them to other countries to compete and then hope they can use all the stuff you learned to, in Donald Trump's words: <i>"make the country great again"</i>opened my eyes to the realm of competitive mathematics beyond the walls of the classroom or even the School. You get to be exposed at an early age to not only teachers but to</p>
